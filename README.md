The Web-based Frontend for Domain Modelling project will implement a web-based frontend for TouchCOREâ€™s domain modelling features. It will interact with a REST-based web server called WebCORE, which provides access to the domain modelling API, user management, and model element ID management. The motivation for this project is that students in classes involving domain modelling could really benefit from an innovative tool to help them learn this topic. Thus, the ultimate goal of this project is to create a functional UI that will help students taking ECSE223, i.e. Model-Based Programming, to learn domain modelling. This project is important because it will provide an optimised alternative to Umple that is easier to use for students.
